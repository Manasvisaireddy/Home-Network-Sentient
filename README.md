# Home Network Sentient – IoT Attack Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes IoT network traffic data to identify and study different types of cyber attacks on smart home devices.

The dataset contains multiple IoT device logs and attack patterns such as DDoS and other malicious activities.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze IoT device behavior
- Detect abnormal traffic patterns
- Understand attack distribution across devices
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory analysis

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes multiple CSV files containing IoT device traffic and attack data.

Due to size constraints, full dataset is included in this repository for analysis purposes.

## 🔎 Key Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Feature analysis
- Attack distribution visualization
- Statistical insights

## 📊 Results
- DDoS attacks showed highest traffic spikes.
- Certain IoT devices were more vulnerable.
- Traffic patterns clearly distinguish normal vs malicious activity.
